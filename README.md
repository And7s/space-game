# remarks

This is a html5 fan remade of the GLX neo luxor game, which i really enjoyed playing.

The highscore does no validation checks i know. Anyone who wants to cheat can do so.

This game gan also played on mobile. If a mobile device is detected on screen buttons are presented. left half of the screen shoots, right side in a triangle formation left up and right buttons.
